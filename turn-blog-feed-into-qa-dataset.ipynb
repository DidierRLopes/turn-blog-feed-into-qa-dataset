      "Q: Didier, you mentioned that when ChatGPT launched, everyone rushed to build financial chatbots  What do you think was the initial excitement about building these chatbots, and what did they miss in their approach?\n",
      "A: The initial excitement around building financial chatbots was likely driven by the promise of automation and efficiency gains. However, they missed that the best AI model is only as good as the data it has access to, and that true value comes from integrating AI into a complete workflow, not just a conversational interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: You stated that the best AI model is useless without access to your data  Can you elaborate on why having access to data is crucial for effective AI implementation in financial analysis? What types of data do you think are most important to have?\n",
      "A: Access to high-quality, relevant data is critical for training and fine-tuning AI models in finance. Proprietary company data, such as financial statements, transactions, and market data, is essential for building accurate predictive models. Having access to this data enables AI to learn patterns, identify trends, and make informed decisions, making it a crucial component of effective AI implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: You mentioned that chatbots can't handle complex financial workflows  What kind of complexities are we talking about here? Are there specific areas of finance where AI is more effective than humans, or vice versa?\n",
      "A: Complex financial workflows involve intricate data relationships, nuanced regulatory requirements, and high-stakes decision-making. In areas like investment analysis, portfolio management, and risk assessment, AI excels at processing vast amounts of data, identifying patterns, and providing predictive insights that humans might miss. However, in tasks requiring human judgment, creativity, and emotional intelligence, such as financial planning, tax consulting, or business strategy development, human expertise remains invaluable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: OpenBB's approach seems to focus on creating intelligent workspaces rather than relying on chatbots  Can you walk us through how your platform ensures complete data access for users? How do you connect different data sources?\n",
      "A: At OpenBB, we ensure complete data access by allowing users to run everything on-premise or in their VPC, connecting any data source via files, APIs, third-party feeds, or a universal data layer that standardizes all formats. This universal data layer enables seamless integration of disparate data sources, such as CSV, Excel, Snowflake, or APIs, into a single workspace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: You mentioned embedding intelligence directly into users' workspaces, rather than forcing them to chat with a bot  What does this mean in practice? How do you envision these intelligent workspaces evolving over time?\n",
      "A: In practice, our intelligent workspaces embed AI capabilities within the user interface, allowing analysts to access data-driven insights and visualizations seamlessly. Over time, we envision these workspaces evolving to incorporate more advanced features such as real-time predictive analytics, automated report generation, and collaborative tools that empower teams to make informed decisions together. By providing a customizable, intuitive environment, OpenBB enables users to harness the power of AI without sacrificing their existing workflows or productivity.\n"
